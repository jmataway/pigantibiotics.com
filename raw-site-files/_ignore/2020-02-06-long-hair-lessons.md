## Some Back Story
About 18 months ago, I decided I would try growing my hair out "long", or at least what would be long for me. Growing up I had always wanted to try growing out my hair and seeing how it would turn out, but I grew up in some weird circumstances that included the length of my hair being "policed" by both my father, and adult men who were not my father. (The fact that I ever let someone who had no relation or real authority towards me try and control personal aspects of myself will be a lesson I carry forever.) Both would try and find ways to punish me if I let my hair get to an "inappropriate" length. For a "normal" person, it may seem weird to read an individual being troubled by a desire for something as mundane as growing their hair passed their ears. It is weird - this should have been a red flag about some things in my life long before I finally accepted it was.

## 18 Months Later
Here I am 18 months later with hair that reaches my shoulder blades. My hair is naturally pretty thick, and has long curls. I was worried it would never grow "down", just keep growing "out" as a curly mess.
