# Welcome!
My name is Joel Mataway. I work as a Technology Operations Engineer (primarily Linux focused) at [EXOS.](https://www.teamexos.com "EXOS Homepage") Some of my technology interests include Linux (of course), systems administration, bash and python scripting, networking, PC hardware, homelabs, and more. Non-technology interests include video games, basketball, watching the Suns pain me over and over, cats, off-roading, and too many other things to list in one sentence.

This site exists to serve as a space for me to store some of my thoughts and ideas. I don't expect anyone else to find it interesting, but if someone happens to then all the better. The blog may contain both technical and non technical entries; though it also may not be updated frequently. If you have stumbled upon this site, fell free to [reach out](mailto:jmataway@yahoo.com) to me with any feedback, or just to say hi!
  
### What is the domain name about?
No I don't sell antibiotcs for pigs. If that market exists, I'm sure it is well saturated by more qualified individuals. The domain name is a reference to a song by one of my all-time favorite bands. If you are familiar with the song based off that, we would likely have an easy topic to bond over.
